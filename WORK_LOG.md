| Jan 13 | 2:30 - 3:00 pm | I brainstormed for a bit. I thought of using an array that measured differences. I thought figuring out the longest consecutive run of positive values could help lead me to the answer. |
| Jan 13 | 9:15 - 9:45 pm |                                                                  I abandoned the diffArr idea. I decided to use integer max/min algorithm style. I got all tests passing except for one. |
| Jan 15 |  1:15 - 1:45   |                                                                                                  I brainstormed a bit more. I decided to write a subroutine. I wanted to calculate dips. |
| Jan 15 |    6 - 6:30    |                              I created a recursion program for calculating longest run in a given interval. I debugged the recursion. I played with different initial and offset values. |
| Jan 15 |    6:30 - 7    |                                                                        I debugged the code. The efficientLarger test was still failing. The number increased, but is still not matching. |
| Jan 15 |    7 - 7:30    |                                                                           I worked on the recursion. I tried debugging with stop points. I could not figure out where I was going wrong. |
| Jan 20 |  4:00 - 4:30   |                                                                  I started working on final version. I used Mr. Blick's pseudocode. I created an array for temperature range -50 to 130. |
| Jan 20 |    4:30 - 5    |                                      I implemented a non-recursive version of code. I did this to understand the algorithm. I wrote a conversion function to get index from temperature. |
| Jan 20 |    5 - 5:30    |                                                                      I had problems passing largest test. All other 4 tests were passing. I ran debug mode to understand the parameters. |
| Jan 20 |    5:30 - 6    |                                                                                                   I fixed errors in array indexing. All tests started passing. I converted to recursion. |
| Jan 20 |    6 - 6:30    |                                                                                                              I tested the code. I debugged in recursion mode. All tests started passing. |
